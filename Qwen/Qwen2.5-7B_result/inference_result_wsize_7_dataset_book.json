The patient was a female from U4 who had made several suicide attempts, all of which had obviously been unsuccessful. She had been placed on 24hr suicide watch. Finally, Tatum came to the most recent file. The file on which Julia had been the social worker, and had subsequently signed off as the responsible clinician on the file page. Tatum didn't see anything unusual in the case notes that would have made Julia save this particular file. This case report was a bit more detailed than the others; Tatum knew requirements for record-keeping had become more substantial over the last several decades. Julia's notes described a young man with a history of sexual abuse. Sounded to Tatum like it may have been at the hands of his step-father, but the identity of the perpetrator had been blacked out. The patient had, as a result of his experience, developed serious issues with depression, anxiety, and anger, and, subsequently, had been involved in several assault incidents, none of which had led to formal charges. Eventually, he was placed on Unit Four with the intent to keep both him and others safe until he stabilized. Tatum again read and re-read the material on the page in front of her. She could not think of any reason that Julia would have held onto these particular files individually, nor could she see any links among the cases described. She carefully placed the files back in the filing cabinet and returned the keys to their concealed location.\n",

Her children were taken away because of neglect due to her inability to care for them due to an alcohol addiction that seemed beyond her control at the time.\nIt broke all our hearts, but we helped her work through her issues as best we could while she stayed at the shelter.\nAnother client who really touched me was from an older generation and had seen so much hardship during his life that I could hardly believe it myself when he told me what he\u2019d been through during his younger years.\nThere\u2019s so much to say about this unit but I\u2019ll stop here with one last thought: It is truly amazing, isn\u2019t it how we all need help sometimes? And yet how many of us are able \u2013 or willing \u2013 admit this simple fact?"

We hear this sound as an oscillation of pressure at our eardrums, which is sensed by hair cells (in an organ called the cochlea) located along a spiral-shaped structure inside the ear canal.\nThe frequency spectrum that is perceived depends upon how these hair cells are stimulated. The lower frequencies produce more stimulation at one end while higher frequencies cause more sensation at another end.\nThe shape of each cell determines which type(s) it will respond best with, so that different parts within your brain can analyze information from them separately.\nThis phenomenon has led scientists over the years to believe there must be some kind-of relationship between pitch and position on an organ called basilar membrane inside ear canal - but no one was able figure out what exactly that could be because every single one had its own opinion about it!\nIn order for us not only understand but also replicate the sound quality"

There were few places a nobleman's daughter might go with her maid and her bodyguard, but the cathedral was one of them. And it was there that she met a young priest/confessor with whom, in Kouklianos's polite language, the girl had \"formed an attachment\". The story ended when their secret was betrayed for money by her bodyguard. One day, he left his post at the cathedral door and her husband's retainers stormed in to drag the priest up one of the octagonal staircases to the roof, taking him out onto the flying buttress from where they tossed him like a heavy sack onto the pavement below.

The United States Government as taught in colleges and even some high schools across the country, are paying many land owners subsidies to not grow crops or raise livestock on their fields and these lands lay dormant. All that money is spent in the name of controlling our economy which in reality, our government has very little or no control over anyway. Tragically, part of the reason we are in this mess is because we already have too many people getting paid to do nothing. Ironically enough, it is those people who usually harass others about not doing enough to progress the workload of our country and vote to try and deny benefits to those who are legitimately injured working dangerous or difficult jobs. It would be far more effective to get a little bit out of everyone over driving those who are working into early graves. With the private distribution of wealth manipulating housing, food, career opportunity and medical costs it is no wonder not everyone is having their needs met. The U.S Human Expedition would use volunteers out in the fields we have paid an overabundance to do nothing with to feed the hungry and show the world that our strength is supported by compassion. I cannot stress enough that our government should not be passing this opportunity onto religious organizations. The Expedition would offer dorms or apartments to get people off the streets and allow those who have been struggling against poverty to stabilize themselves and stand on their own feet once more or even for the first time. With the U.S. Human Expedition in place and in co-operation with President Obama's health care plan, insurance underwriters will not have the chance to deny someone life over frivolous paperwork errors and those with pre-existing conditions will not face a lapse in care. During the transition, the U.S. Human Expedition will have experts assigned to cases where legitimate claims are denied in the name of money. At one point the military may be in control of medical care so the private distribution of wealth cannot over capitalize on an individual's right to live at the choke point of medical needs and force the inability to fulfill the unrealistic demands of such monetary costs.

Once people have their needs fulfilled and maintained, the statistical likeliness they will engage in illegal activity will dramatically decline.

There is no reason for one to want to surrender their power to death when they can make the simple changes that is expected of them. This is how the royal family in England was able to stay in power after the fall of French monarchies during the French Revolution. The king of England at that time knew if he did not bridge the gap between his power and the will of the people, the monarchic structure that he ruled would face the same destiny. This is how the British Parliament came to be, he volunteered a portion of his power so that he can keep some of what it is he wanted to have instead of losing it all. Once the U.S. Human Expedition has set a couple of successful examples and shows that the U.S. is not going to back stab them with cloak and dagger trained spooks, people will not have issues in working with us to achieve a greater means of life. With people loving the United States around the world instead of vigorously hating us, the people of the United States will not be at as much risk traveling the world and the State Department will have far less diplomatic hassles to deal with. By taking this military strategy to a global level, we can effectively undercut the ability of any other factions to recruit to any means other than peace. Terrorist groups, drug cartels, mafias, religious organizations and even other countries will feel the effects of such a demonstration of power through smaller numbers in both resources and humans taking a role among their factions.

So why don't we put all the diesel engines we make in trains?\n\nThe first thing people might think would be that this would be too expensive for the average consumer train operator. This is only partially true as it depends on how far a train runs and how many times a year it operates on that route. The first train route I thought up was between Denver and San Francisco which runs through several mountain ranges, so it should be pretty expensive to operate a diesel-powered rail line, even with our new engine.\n\nHowever if you were operating a commuter rail line, or even just short distance passenger service like in New York City (where I'm going right now) you probably could afford it since your trains don\u2019t have to run very often or for very long distances.\n\nBut wait\u2026 there's another problem here!

We must be able and legally allowed to issue orders that will protect the mission objectives and the people we are reaching out to help.

I find it odd how often police officers like to use that term, except fail to understand how it should also apply within the government. In that kind of situation if you are not somehow part of the solution, you are part of the problem and that is exactly what the Somalis saw when our helicopters circled over head and allowed militias to seize the supplies meant for them.

Allowing an enemy force to take our goods and appear superior or compassionate in our place contradicts our operational purpose.

It would be up to the highest rank on the scene to determine if there is a tactical advantage to fighting the enemy. Each explorer will have to make their own personal decision on if they would arm themselves or not and either way, no one would think down on them. I am predicting odds are one out of fifty or sixty explorers would actually be armed in more peaceful areas where occasional violence does occur. In more dangerous areas probably one out of every five or ten explorers will have firearms.

It was the first time humans had ever seen such a sight and they were amazed by what they saw.\nThis photo of Earth has been described as one of mankind's greatest achievements: It shows our home planet looking small but beautiful against a backdrop of stars and galaxies beyond us - something we can only imagine looking up at on any given night when we gaze up into space with wonderment at all there might be beyond just ourselves here inside this little blue marble called \u201cEarth.\"\nThe Earth looks like an oasis in space when viewed from the moon. It appears as though there are no signs or markings whatsoever, just vast oceans with some small islands floating around within them.\nWhen you look out into space"

There are some types of resources that are limited and those resources do need to be cultivated and maintained with balance somehow.

A Human Expedition checkpoint will develop in levels much like the branch itself will grow in phases. Level one is a basic camp at first where people can go to at least get a meal a few times a day and maybe even sleep on cots or in sleeping bags inside tents. A level one checkpoint prepares for level two if the checkpoint is cleared to become a permanent location and construction based volunteers begin building new shelter. Level two checkpoints are when a building is established such as an apartment or dorm. Each level two checkpoint will also have a kitchen in it so people have a nearby place to go for their meals. Supply missions will bring in goods to checkpoints to keep them up and running. Domestic checkpoint supply missions will usually just by delivery trucks like how we do business normally bringing in supplies to restaurants and stores. In more rural areas or more threatening environments around the world when we expand out, supply missions will come with heavier risk. A level three checkpoint is not much different from level two, level three checkpoints will be a supply depot or focal point to a smaller town or village. If a checkpoint is ready to expand beyond level three it will simply become a base and will have everything that would come with being on a military installation. Expedition bases will all cultivate their own resources at one point. Police departments would have detachments out of the domestic bases and work with liaisons to make sure the peace is being kept during distribution and in living environments provided by the federal government. Any criminal activity engaged in on federal property would be a federal offense like any other federal facility. If the Department of Defense saw it fit to change some non-combative M.O.S.s over to the Human Expedition, it may make us more welcoming in places we already occupy. We can if approved by the right authorities create overseas checkpoints in such areas to see how people warm up to the new way of us doing things. Once we have secured 90% of our domestic population from poverty and have a few successful outreach checkpoints established, we will shift into the beginning of phase three.

This can happen with entities from different realms such ghosts (which are not necessarily evil), demons/ devils and fallen angels. These beings may also appear during a past-life regression session.\nIn order for us here on earth who want help from beyond, we must first understand where they\u2019re coming from: why would someone want me? Why does this individual need my support? What do I have that he/she cannot find anywhere else?\nThese questions should guide how you approach any contact with these kinds of entities \u2013 whether they\u2019re here because they\u2019ve decided voluntarily (or perhaps been summoned by someone else)"

What about the creatures that Apollyon supposedly lords overthe scorpion-like amalgamations that torture peoplewas that his primary role, to torture people? Jeremy Chikalto, the thug of God, to be cast away after the dirty deed was done.... Or was it that Apollyon was Lucifer. Why was the passage so cryptic? Why couldn't Jeremy just sing and dance with Maren? Jeremy envied those without his burden. Humility was a lack of pride, yes, but humility also required obedience.

It seems as if our troops are the only people who think that America should be able (or even be allowed) to go into a foreign nation at will. It's true that our country can send our troops anywhere we want them sent without having a formal \"invitation\" from the host nation's government; but we can only get away doing this because it is a democracy (as opposed an oligarchy) and the people who live there want us here (for the most part).\n\nBut it should be clear by now that we cannot simply send soldiers into any country without first getting permission from its government. There are a number reasons why:\n\n  \u2022 It may be against international law\n    \u2022 The Geneva Conventions clearly state who can go onto another country.\n    \u2022 The United Nations has specific rules governing when and how countries are allowed to go onto other countries.\n"

But though she was polite, I could sense she had little desire to form any close friendship with me. The youngest sister, Kitty, was about Caleb's age and by far the most beautiful of the Leighton children. Her smooth slightly tanned skin was accentuated by her blonde hair and bright smile. The blue eyes was the only trait that she seemed to share with the rest of the clan. She was by far the most eager to want to get to know me, but upon each attempt she was pulled away by one of the other family members. I did not see this as a slight upon me, but more of a courtesy to James. I was his friend, a title that I was blessed to be given.\n",

Over time William started to care about the girl as well, and they became good friends. William knew to be very careful around the human children, but on Valentine's Day sweet Emily brought William a Valentine's Day card. When he turned around on the playground, she planted a big kiss upon William's lips.

Poor Emily's lifeless body fell to the ground, as William stared on in horror as his only friend died. Of course no one could find William at fault, and the girl's death was ruled an undiagnosed fatal medical condition, but poor young William knew the truth, and was forced to live with the guilt that comes with taking a life. It was at that time that his parents found me, and relocated from Charleston to the area. He was immediately pulled from school and hidden away here by his parents out of fear that if Sironian officials found out about the incident, then they would all be killed.

I would have to talk to William about this as soon as we were alone.

I was confused, but my mother was grieving so, that I waited to speak with her about the situation. I assumed I was adopted, but it always seemed that I was something other than normal. Silas called her not long after my father's death; I was outside and so she assumed that I couldn't hear their conversation. It was the first time they had spoken since I was born. This is how I discovered I was part Sironian. I overheard a telephone conversation my mother shared with Silas. He asked if any of the Sironian traits had been passed to me and seemed relieved when she told him they had not. I wanted to speak with my biological father, to learn what I was but had no idea how to find him. I decided not to let my mother know that I had learned of what I was and have devoted much of my adult life searching for answers. The more I researched the Sironians, the more it became imperative that I keep all of you away from them. I wanted to keep our family's entire existence a secret. I took a job that would allow me to travel a bit, and as I traveled along the coast on these trips, I listened. It took almost five years before I was able to discover my first group of Sironians. They live just south of Charleston near Folly Beach. I studied their conversations for months while working on the beach renourishment project that I had been hired to oversee. In fact, all of my knowledge of Sironian life has been gleamed from conversations that I have overheard over the years, as most of the written accounts of the siren life is nothing more than folklore.

There is no clear consensus regarding the use of this approach as it raises questions about honesty, trust and integrity. The level of dementia is recognised as having great relevance on deciding whether therapeutic lying is appropriate or not. The acceptability of therapeutic lying is recognised to be a complex issue and its use depends on a number of factors, including who is lying, the relationships involved, the motive behind the lie, the nature of the lie and the understanding and capacity of the person with dementia and their stage in the disease process. Of particular significance is the apparent high prevalence of therapeutic lying despite the fact that a review of the codes of professional conducts state that the practitioner must tell the truth. In fact being untruthful is likely to put professional registration at risk.

The consensus is that when caring for a person with dementia in the context of the best approach to take when they ask questions or make statements that are false, that there is no single approach that will suit each person or be appropriate every time.

A key requirement for making these judgements is that carers must know the person with dementia including their preferences and know what their families think. In the context of nursing home care the detailed life history of the person with dementia is considered crucial to this process. Consequently the governance structure within which practitioners are working must take cognisance of this and focus on capacity development for carers through training and education as opposed to creating a prescriptive model of care. It is also clear that a discrepancy exists between respective health professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines and health professionals' use of therapeutic lying, which is an alternative approach to truth telling or correcting the person with dementia. This has serious practical implications for health professionals. This paradox also increases the risk for violation of the dignity of people with dementia and of professional carers and therefore the formal regulatory frameworks merit urgent review and attention.\n",

Strategies include both the person with dementia and their carer retreating together into the past, and in doing so, experiencing the lived and more vivid experiences of the person with dementia.

In contrast to living in an unfamiliar present, retreating to a familiar past is far more pleasing and less stressful for the person with dementia (Douglas et al. 2004). According to Kitwood (1997), validation therapy is recognised as offering a good level of empathy with the intention of understanding a person's entire frame of reference. However, researchers argue that, like many psychosocial interventions advocated for use in dementia care, validation therapy does not have a definitive theoretical underpinning and the evidence to support its use stems largely from observational studies. These studies report that, validation therapy promotes better communication and interaction between the carer and person with dementia; it has a positive effect on behavioural symptoms and enhances the quality of life of both carer and person with dementia (Bleathman & Morton, 1988; Babins, 1998). However, converse to findings arising from qualitative studies, evidence from the most recent Cochrane systematic review (Neal & Wright, 2003), evaluating the effectiveness of validation therapy for people with dementia concludes that there is inadequate evidence to support the use of validation therapy for people with dementia. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review but because of the diversity in duration of treatment, lack of comparability between control groups and outcome measurements, pooled analysis was not feasible.

        "reference_text": " autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence. Autonomy centres on the person's right to self-determination and the carer's role in promoting independence for the purpose of realising self-determination (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Beneficence is about making decisions that are in the best interest of the person with dementia and non-maleficence is about minimising harm to the person with dementia (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Therapeutic lying can threaten a person's autonomy when it is used to deny the voice of the person with dementia in their care whilst only achieving short term goals such as reducing agitation (Brannelly and Whitewood (2014). However, therapeutic lying may be considered acceptable when non-maleficence and compassion are its motives (Sperber 2014; Stubbs, 2013; Tuckett, 2012). It is also important to consider the impact of therapeutic lying on the carer. Trust is a moral principle of care, and lying compromises the trusting relationship between the person with dementia and their carer (Feil & Altman, 2004; Schermer, 2007; Barnes & Brannelly, 2008). This behaviour/action may therefore have a negative impact on the carer who may feel uncomfortable with the deception and the associated impact on their integrity (Schermer, 2007). The literature also highlights that the stage of dementia is an important consideration when deciding to use therapeutic lying. Taylor (2007), writing from the perspective of the person with dementia, asserts that lying is not acceptable to people in the early stages of dementia as it heightens that disconnect that they experience from reality. However as dementia progresses and capacity diminishes, the less possible it becomes for the person with dementia to entertain beliefs, either false or true. Schermer (2007) purports that lying to someone requires a capacity to hold beliefs about what is true and what is not, thus making it conceptually impossible to lie to someone in an advanced state of dementia. If a person is not aware of being 'lied' to due to memory loss, the 'deception' may be viewed as less threatening and potentially beneficial (Kartalova-O'Doherty et al. 2014).

They found that the majority of health professionals (96.5%) reported that they lied to residents with dementia. Over half the staff (51.1%) used lying to promote compliance and to benefit staff and save time (30.2%). Likewise, Culley et al. (2013) found that of the 29 psychiatrists surveyed on the use of therapeutic lying, the majority (69%) reported they had lied to people with dementia when it was deemed to be in the best interests of the person. Elvish et al. (2010) also found that lying was more acceptable to health care professionals when the focus was to reduce harm to the person with dementia. Their study used a two phased design, the first of which involved developing and piloting the attitudes towards lying to people with dementia (ALPD) questionnaire; and the second aimed at validating the questionnaire at a workshop. In phase one, participants (n=151), including psychologists, nurses, care workers and social workers, were asked to complete the newly developed questionnaire. Results showed that lying was considered more acceptable when it was in the person's best interest or to prevent injury as opposed to being used for the purpose of compliance. Tuckett (2012) also found lying was used by nurses and allied health professionals (n=18) caring for people with dementia for the purpose of eliminating harm and to control behaviour. In this study, the consequences of lying were important as identified by the concept of 'settling' a resident by lying to them. Participants identified validating the person with dementia's reality as benevolent lying as opposed to 'out and out' lying.

Jacobson argues that every human interaction has the potential to be a 'dignity encounter'.

Dignity violation is more likely to result from an encounter in which there is a power imbalance with one person placed in a position of vulnerability due for example to cognitive impairment as in the case of the person with dementia. The impact is further exacerbated when the other actor is not sympathetic due to prejudice, personality or ignorance. The setting in which encounters take place can also exacerbate the situation. So-called harsh environments that fail to take account of the diversity of users, serve to reinforce distance and power imbalances. Jacobson (2009) characterises these settings as hierarchal and inflexible characterised by stress and a sense of urgency but deficient in resources. The people working in such environments are less likely to be empathetic to others and are also more likely to perceive questioning or non-cooperation as an 'attack on their dignity'.

It is worth noting therefore that research on the use of informal efforts to support staff in therapeutic lying (Culley et al. 2013; Day et al. 2011) appear to be at odds with professional guidance to be truthful at all times.\n",

Yet once a number of caveats are in place carers and people with dementia appear to accept the merits of therapeutic lying. However, it is clear that further research is required that include the perceptions of people with dementia formal and informal carers as well as the views of other established experts in the field of dementia and care of older people.

A qualitative descriptive approach is appropriate when seeking to understand complex 'phenomena' (as is the case in this study) and the use of this approach provides a description of and facilitates understanding of persons' with dementia and informal/unpaid carer's experiences and perceptions. The strength of qualitative descriptive designs in comparison to other qualitative approaches is that it \"obtains straight and largely unadorned (i.e. minimally theorized) answers to questions of relevance to practitioners and policy makers\" (Sandelowski 2000 p.337). Using this approach enabled the collection of detailed feedback from persons with dementia and informal/unpaid carers on their experiences.

Carer participants expressed concern however, that lying could increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship with the person. Several alternative strategies to managing the person's anxiety, stress or agitation were identified. These ranged from: telling the truth, moving on the conversation, reframing the situation, distraction and \"going with\" the person. Carer participants did however confront or correct the person if they believed it was in their best interests. \"Empathetic deception\" captures their approach to \"lying\" or telling the truth: it was done in the person's best interest, in context of knowing what matters to the person and in a way that maintained the person's dignity. The person's capacity (loosely aligned to stage of dementia) was also considered and reflected in using different types of strategies e.g. it was more likely that carers would tell the truth in earlier stages and lie by omission or avoidance in the later stages. At the heart of carers' actions was the intention to benefit the person. They viewed an individualised approach, tailored to the person's needs and life history as critical, they questioned the benefit of hard and fast rules on \"what to do\" therefore. In context of the actions that formal carers should take, carers saw that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia's personhood in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. Consequently they considered they had a role to play in preserving the person. They advised that in formal care settings a care plan should be agreed that reflected this knowledge.\n",

People with dementia and carers agreed that lying is not acceptable in certain circumstances, for example, when the person is aware and striving to retain control and autonomy. To lie would undermine their efforts. Both groups acknowledged that therapeutic lying was appropriate if it clearly benefited the person i.e. diminished or allayed distress or agitation. However, the nature of the lie as well as the intention matters. A small lie (for example, reframing, distracting or moving the conversation on) was acceptable, whereas a blatant lie with the intention to fool or manipulate the person was not acceptable. The person's beliefs and values must be central to the decision on what action to take. The person's awareness of his/her deficits must also be considered (loosely linked to stage of dementia). Carer participants indicated that knowing the person and what was appropriate to and for them was critical. Both groups flagged the importance of maintaining the person's dignity and respecting his/her personhood. The risk-benefit of therapeutic lying should be assessed in context of the individual needs therefore. Furthermore the actions of formal carers should be negotiated and agreed with carers and/or the person with dementia where possible.

The Delphi technique is a multistage process involving a series of questionnaire rounds, interspersed by controlled feedback based on the results of previous rounds that seek to gain the most reliable consensus of opinion of a group of experts (Linstone & Turoff, 1975; Gordon & Pease, 2005; Vernon, 2009). It involves progressive rounds of survey construction, analysis and iterative revision until predefined criteria for consensus are reached. Participants receive feedback on responses to previous rounds and can use this feedback to inform their decisions about future survey responses and the process continues until there is emergence of consensus (Gordon & Pease 2006; Vernon 2009). Delphi studies commonly comprise three rounds before consensus is achieved (Hasson et al. 2000; Hanafin & Brooks 2005).

The two groups were not brought together at any time during the research process as their areas of expertise did not overlap substantially.\nThe first round involved open-ended questions that allowed participants an opportunity to provide as much information as they wished about their opinions on the issues identified during literature review (n=800), followed by a list containing all identified issues with accompanying space allowing for any additions or deletions that might be necessary in order for participants to reach consensus among themselves and provide input on their priority ranking. All participants were given three hours to respond during which they could work independently or collaboratively with others.

A review of 13 published Delphi studies found that panel size varied from 10 to 3000 (Reid 1998; Campell & Cantrill 2001). Keeney et al.

They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. At the heart of informal/unpaid carers actions was the intention to benefit the person with dementia and they reported that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. A few informal/unpaid carers in the current study reported that they sometimes felt uncomfortable 'lying' to the person with dementia as it might increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship. However, similar to the findings in (Green 2015), it appeared that the benefits of reducing upset for the person with dementia offset these concerns. The use of therapeutic lying therefore in instances when people with dementia who ask questions or make statements that are false is, similar to the literature, deemed to be an acceptable strategy both by health professionals, informal/unpaid carers and people with dementia.

In this context, acceptable approaches included therapeutic lying as well as the use of distraction and avoiding the false statement or question asked. Participants were clear that the dignity of the person with dementia must never be undermined and highlighted the importance of trust in relationships and the importance of carers taking time to get to know and understand the person. Such encounters have the potential to promote dignity (Jacobson 2012). The environment where two people meet is also important. If the person with dementia does not feel safe and secure then the potential for violation of dignity is increased. Finally, the policy and social context, within which encounters take place, has a major influence on whether encounters will promote or violate dignity.

In the context of nursing home care the detailed life history of the person with dementia is considered crucial to this process. Consequently the governance structure within which practitioners are working must take cognisance of this and focus on capacity development for carers through training and education as opposed to creating a prescriptive model of care. It is also clear that a discrepancy exists between respective health professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines and health professionals use of therapeutic lying, which is an alternative approach to truth telling or correcting the person with dementia.

That sun was small and sharp but very intense and would be fully exposed within seconds with the aid of a rapidly spinning world.

This one was larger and softer and took several minutes before its full disk was visible. He could recall its like from much deeper in the recesses of his mind. It was, when he forced his mind back, much more like Sol, the sun that had shone over Earth - the planet of his birth. For a moment the memory of sunrise on Earth displaced more recent recollections, drawing him back through decades, through centuries of time to the last time he had seen it, or indeed anything like it.

He'd forced himself to suppress as much of that emotion as he could for the sake of a smooth transition to a new life, pushing aside anything that might make him regret the decision. Now it seemed circumstance had pulled those memories to the surface once more. So vivid were they that a thought began to form in his mind, starting as a question and expanding rapidly to a doubt that was not easily shaken off. A sun like Earth's sun, lighting a day the duration of Earth's day, with air and water and plants and animals just like those of Earth. Might it be that his expected purpose had been abandoned after all? Was it possible that instead of being thrown further into the unknown universe than any other human being, he had simply been returned home?

The Hosts had provided for him what he needed to survive physically, but he had other needs that they had missed - for society, for companionship, for connection - needs that reached beyond the physical to the core of his humanity. Now that he had something to care about other than his own survival, now that he had purpose and project, some of that humanity could surface again. The crucial step was giving them names. Names were an important part of the process. He had already known that language was something he needed to hold onto even here where he was alone, and had taken some steps to do that, but now with the first stirring of a family that need seemed more urgent. He had named the planet and decided to give names to everything else he felt was important to him, the rivers and forests and oceans, all the major landmarks and singular features of this environment.

It was only an assumption on his part that his own existence was of greater value to them than that of the zebra he had sacrificed, or the lion that saw him as prey. In the end he had to make his own choices. Where responsibility to a higher moral purpose - of which he was only dimly aware - came into conflict with his responsibility to himself, he had to form his own priorities as well.

Secondly, it sat very neatly on the divide between two of the major masses of near black - the dark green of Grand Australis on the left, and the even larger mass of dark red to the right, which was north. Whatever those colour variations might signify, that placement seemed to be purposeful. Like the Mid Range mountains far off to the south-west, it appeared to have an effect on the patterns of cloud and weather around it, and looked to be casting a particularly long shadow at the appropriate times of day when conditions were clear enough to see it. Moreover when the clouds in its vicinity were calm it often even appeared above them, a clear brown dot on a field of white. All of this suggested its true size was very large for such an isolated thing. And when the surrounding surface was darkened by shadow or night, it was that spot which most often marked concentrations of faint points of light nearby.

These vessels were made by using logs that naturally grew on river shores in Egypt to form large canyons; then they cut them off and fitted planks around them so that they could be steered by oarsmen or sailmen.

But somewhere in the interval between falling asleep in his home on Aurigae and waking up in a new home on Orion, life had been found and confirmed. Not once, but several times.

As he looked over what he had written and thought about what he had seen that afternoon, the true significance of his situation on this planet began, as if for the first time, to penetrate into his awareness. Planets on which aboriginal life of even the simplest kind had come to exist were rare in the universe. They were known to be rare. The conditions which led to the spontaneous formation of living matter were tightly constrained, and the obstacles to its formation were numerous. And planets where aboriginal life thrived and evolved were even rarer. As a youth, living and growing on Earth, not a single instance other than Earth itself was known. Not one. Indeed by the time the first such example was confirmed in the Milky Way, the number of planets supporting relocated colonies of terrestrial life exceeded all those supporting native life that would ever be found in that galaxy. He himself had visited or occupied several worlds other than Earth, and had lived several lifetimes separated by millennia of sleep, before learning that organisms not descended from those of his own homeworld even existed. By that time the rarity of naturally occurring living ecosystems had become a point of moral concern in its own right. Such planets were afforded protection from any and all interference. For the sake of curiosity, non-terrestrial life could be studied, but only on the proviso and to the extent that the flow of information from those studies was strictly one way. Natural human senses were far too clumsy to provide any assurance to that effect, and so human flesh, in any of its forms, had never been in direct contact with any life not drawn from the ecosystems of Earth.\n",

        "reference_text": ", however, was much older than that - dating back to long before it symbolised anything at all. Back to when the stars and the patterns they formed on the sky had only ever been seen from a single point in space and very nearly a single point in time. Back to the childhood of humanity, and to his own childhood, on Earth. There those patterns of stars appeared fixed and eternal, and because they were fixed they could be identified with names that stuck for the lifetimes of those that named them, and their children, and their grandchildren. They were named for animals - lions and bulls and scorpions. They were named for people - hunters and maidens and water bearers. They were named for things - scales and crosses. And they were named for mythical beasts like the one with the head and chest of a human and the hindquarters of a horse - the Centaur. Even when it became known that those patterns were not fixed - not just as a theory but as the real passage of time and the shifting perspective across huge spans of space had distorted them beyond all recognition - even when the original namers had been dead for many generations - even then some part of those names could be found clinging to some of the stars and other objects that had made up the patterns originally. And so it was when the very first evidence of mind on a par with that which had long before descended from humankind was discovered and confirmed, it was discovered in a galaxy that had once occupied the pattern of the Centaur. The galaxy itself had been renamed and renumbered so often that all connection to its origin was broken. The priests of OldEarth had called it Tingard, a name whose origin was itself an entirely different story. But the beings that lived there, whose activities had been seen from so great a distance, even when nothing else at all was known about them, were given a name that retained some shadow of that long history: Kenthoni - those that dwell with the Centaurs.\n",

That, he recognised easily, was a terramine, confirming what he already knew \\- that, like NewEarth, this world was being artificially re-purposed for life not native to it. To the west of the terramine and spanning a wide area further in that direction was what appeared to be a dense forest of tall lime-green spikes. They must have been very large to be so clearly visible from so great a distance, but they were also disorderly to the point of looking almost comical, sticking out randomly at a variety of angles as if tussled by a giant hand. To the east and spreading around to the north the clumps of sponge grass merged into a continuous landscape of undulating black hills. Of greater interest however, in the middle distance in the direction of the forest he counted five of the kenthoni cloud masses, spread out over a small angle. They were showing the same kind of organised pulsations he had seen on the coast. Two of them were sitting high above the ground, each atop its own elaborate brown platform as large as a city block.

Or it might equally have a perfectly mundane explanation - some of these creatures were fearful and hateful of anything appearing in their world as new or strange while others were tolerant and accepting. Was that really so different from what might be expected of his own race - indeed what he knew to be the case from history, and had frequently observed with his own eyes? It even made sense that this would be the case. Life was fragile and its continued existence required treading the fine line marking the boundary between those circumstances necessary to maintain it, and those circumstances sufficient to extinguish it. Where the environment alone did not guarantee that line could be held, intelligence arose to force it actively, and the more delicate and complex the balancing act became, the more intelligence evolved to sustain it. The result was, perhaps, a universal - representing precisely the two attitudes that might reasonably be expected from sentient life when it encountered something new - fear and curiosity. The great conflict. On the positive side it was a sign of intelligence that individuals drawn from the same species could differ so radically in their behaviour. It suggested personality, diversity of opinion and abstraction of thought - the very traits he had come to find. But it also left him wondering how great an upheaval his arrival on this world had been for these creatures. Was it something that had been expected, even anticipated, or was it a culture shock that felt to them like an invasion? And what knowledge of him did they possess before he had appeared in front of them? Did they have any contact with the Hosts, and how were they related to the Hosts? Had they been briefed on who he was, what he was and where he had come from - or did they know as much about him as he knew about them - which was essentially nothing?

He had seen something similar among the coastal natives as well - often stepping up closer to Johnny and Bee-Friend and observing that state more intently than was probably appropriate - where he had made careful note of the various kinds of patterns displayed, ranging from the indecipherably abstract to distorted semblances of physical objects, not infrequently including his own humanoid form.

That destination was still some way off when the first rays of the rising sun appeared over the low hills in the east, deep crimson in a purple sky. A mounted kenthoni hive was visible in the distance to the right, clearly stirring from slumber as the central swarm expanded in the light of morning, and beginning to display the intricate spirals and ripples characteristic of wakeful attention. Initially not overly worried he continued walking, though with the faint air of someone moving through a potentially hostile neighbourhood. A vibration through the ground and a rhythmic mechanical sound drew his attention back to the hive. It was no longer just the dark cloud of wasps that had become active - the rusty mount it was sitting on was billowing plumes of black smoke that quickly settled into grey wisps. It jerked from side to side once or twice and began to inch forward, its huge caterpillar treads visibly churning the ground as they started to rotate. The thing was indeed mobile as he had suspected - remarkably mobile in fact as it picked up speed - and heading in his direction. Even then he was more intrigued than concerned, but nonetheless thought it best not to wait so exposed to assess its intentions, and picked up his own pace towards the safety of the airlock. His concern grew with the realisation that a combination of his own hobbled pace and the considerable speed the vehicle had attained would easily place it between himself and his goal. To make the situation worse, long before the gap between them had closed the malleable form of the kenthoni rider began stretching itself towards him. His final faint hope that this might be a display of innocent curiosity was dashed when the swarm hit with both substantial force and deliberate intent. With astonishing precision and dexterity a volley of wasp strikes knocked him face first to the ground with well aimed blows to the back of his knees, and pinned him there by concerted attention to his legs, back and wrists - a constant stream of impacting insects delivering a continuous force that made very effective shackles. It was as if they had contemplated his possible vulnerabilities and were now testing those ideas - successfully. They proceeded then to strip the worm silk from his skin and clothes, and he briefly had an idea that they might have been trying to help him, until they started using it with great skill to bind him even further. Within minutes he was completely immobilised. The physical assault subsided enough for him to sense the vibrations through the ground becoming stronger and the mechanical throbbing of the mobile becoming louder. From his prone position he was able to see the huge vehicle coming closer, and for a terrifying moment he thought it would run right over him. But it rolled slowly past, its great metal treads mere meters from his head - close enough that he could feel the coarse clay dirt crack under the weight, close enough that he could feel greasy black lubricant from the axles splashing him, close enough that he could tell its rust red appearance was more than just a colour choice. The thing really did appear to be made of rusted iron, honed smooth and functional as a building material in its own right, but creating to his eyes the impression of great age and ongoing deterioration, as if it had been salvaged from a junkyard. It continued lumbering past him, its rear end towering above like an ancient metal pantechnicon, dripping with black grease and puffing steam from numerous vents.\n",

Rather they were intimately connected to it, drawing from it the energies and materials of life.

Every animate creature in this ecosystem was associated with a sessile plant body, and the association was not merely incidental. The conclusion his studies were rapidly converging to was that the animate organisms of this world grew directly from the vegetation, like fruit.

Of those ninety thousand life producing worlds, barely one hundred and fifty had forms of life more complex than jellyfish.

They were meant to be together, so the conflict he was unwittingly creating was more widespread than was even apparent at first glance. And there were still larger mysteries here.

Scales of existence that had no bearing on parochial tooth and claw survival and adaptability, the guiding hands by which evolution sculpted its forms, somehow managed to be included in the results. But to evolve a mind able to understand itself, that had always seemed too great a feat to ask. So for much of humanity's push to understand the universe in which it existed, the mind itself was not thought part of that universe. From that error had arisen various forms of superstition and religion and spurious philosophy that had continued to influence human thinking and delay human progress even well into his own early days. That idea had long ago been proven to be untrue, but the human mind had certainly not evolved to understand itself. Indeed it had always been imagined that it could not have evolved to understand itself. Eventually the understanding of mind by mind was achieved, but at the cost of being by something other than evolved humans themselves. Rather, it was the artificial progeny of natural humans, beings with minds designed to think in different ways who had attained that goal. Once done it was a prize that yielded a thousandfold its cost in profit, ushering in a new era which saw the descendants of humankind - and sometimes individual humans, like himself - wend their way among the stars.\n",

Here are a few reasons why this happens:\n\n1. **Scope and Complexity**: Big questions like \"if there is but one lesson to learn, why are we such slow learners?\" encompass multiple layers of complexity. They involve various aspects such as cognitive psychology, societal structures, individual differences, education systems, and more. Addressing each layer requires significant time and resources.\n\n2. **Information Overload**: With so many interconnected topics related to learning processes\u2014such as memory formation, attention management, emotional intelligence\u2014you can become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Answers**: Complex problems often don\u2019t have straightforward answers that can be easily applied or understood. This lack of direct guidance makes it harder for individuals to grasp concepts quickly or effectively.\n\n4. **Individual Differences**: People process information differently based on their experiences, backgrounds, and personal traits (e.g., learning styles), which adds another layer of variability making it challenging for universal solutions to emerge easily.\n\n5. **Systemic Issues**: Sometimes the root cause lies not just within individual behavior but also in broader systemic issues like faulty educational methods or socio-cultural norms that hinder effective learning practices.\n\n"
